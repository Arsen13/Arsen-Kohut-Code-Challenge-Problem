## Problem 5: A Crude Server

In this task I developed a backend server with ExpressJS. I was required to build a set of CRUD interfaces that allow a user to interact with the service.

## Installation Steps 

1. Install the dependencies `npm install`

2. Run the server with `npm run dev` and visit http://localhost:3000/

#### Localhost links

The Todo List API urls are: 
- POST http://localhost:3000/todos
- GET all todos http://localhost:3000/todos
- GET todo by id http://localhost:3000/todos/:id
- PUT http://localhost:3000/todos/:id
- DELETE http://localhost:3000/delete-todo/:id
